# Prodigy_task-5-
# Task (5) - Machine Learning Project 

This repository contains the code and resources for Task (5). The project demonstrates implementation of a Machine Learning model with an interactive frontend and clean design.

# Project Structure

index.html → Main user interface

styles.css → Styling for the project

script.js → Core logic & interactivity

(Other supporting files are included in the folder)

# Features

User-friendly web interface

Integration of Machine Learning model for predictions

Responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Easy to run in any modern browser

# Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling

JavaScript – Frontend logic & interactivity

(Optional: Add Python/ML libraries if included, e.g., scikit-learn, pandas)

# Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

Preprocess dataset and apply ML techniques.

Implement a prediction model (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).

Provide an interactive frontend for user interaction.

# How to Run
